I'm a react-native developer and indie maker from France.

I'm passionate about creating high-quality apps that help people improve their health and fitness. One of my most recent projects is Fitrest. A fitness app that I designed and developed from the ground up. I used react-native to build the app, which allows it to be used on both iOS and Android devices. 

I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies to improve my skills and deliver the best possible user experience. In my free time, I love to stay active by going for runs and hitting the gym.
